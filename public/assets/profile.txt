Over the last 6 years, I have developed a wide range of web apps for small to big enterprises. 
Importantly, I have rich hands-on expreience in web development along with implementing highly-responsive user interface components by deploying React concepts and this is definitely one thing that could give me an edge over others.
I am proficient in translating designs and wireframes into high-quality code with best-practise design patterns from the very beginning. 
What truely sets me apart from the others is that I am a super user of UI libraries including Google Material UI, so this means that I can bring your idea into reality in very short period of time with perfect result.

As for my personal characteristic, I thrive on challenge, I work well under pressure and I would describe myself as detail-oriented and proactive.
And also, as a committed team player, I could leverage all of my knowledge and experience to easily adapt to the new situations and work environments.
